# Prepare

In this folder, you will find 4 examples:
- A-minimal: this is an example of a very minimal yet functional dockerfile with a minimal API
- B-fastapi-minimal: still miminal, but using the FastAPI framework for the API
- C-html-minimal: this adds a very basic HTML frontend to the FastAPI backend
- D-compose: this is an example of how two docker containers (a backend and a frontend) can be connected using docker-compose

Every folder has a `README.md` file and some exercises. Work through the exercises.

# E-exercise
In the fifth folder, you will find an exercise where you have to dockerize a data science pipeline. The README.md in that folder contains the details of the exercise.

This exercise has two goals:
- familiarize you with docker and docker compose, and all the caveats that come with it
- help you understand how you move from jupyter notebooks to a production-ready pipeline
- lets you practice with docker and docker compose, such that you will be able to deploy your version of the `straattaal` project for your portfolio.
